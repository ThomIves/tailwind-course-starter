Tom Phillips Tailwind CSS Course Code for Troubleshooting

Hi Tom. I looked over the questions on this issue, but they seemed to be with the previous version of Tailwind.

Simply put, everything is working up to the middle of the lecture 14, but the top "bun" of my hamburger won't rotate.

When I check the console, the JavaScript is working right.

When I check the HTML inspector, the class name of open is being added.

The top "bun" just won't rotate.
